# Jenkins ML Pipeline
This project automates the end-to-end machine learning training pipeline using Jenkins, ensuring seamless integration and automation. When new data arrives or code is updated, the pipeline automatically preprocesses the data, trains a machine learning model, evaluates its performance, saves the model with versioning, and logs the entire workflow.
